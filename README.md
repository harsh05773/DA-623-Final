This repository contains the code and resources for our DA623 course project at IIT Guwahati. Our project is based on the paper "InstructPix2Pix: Learning to Follow Image Editing Instructions".
To explore and replicate the **InstructPix2Pix** model, which performs photorealistic image editing based on natural language instructions. Our goal is to understand its underlying architecture and fine-tune 
or extend its functionality for custom use cases.
InstructPix2Pix is a diffusion-based model trained with a modified **Stable Diffusion** architecture. It takes an input image and a text instruction, then produces an edited image that aligns with the textual 
prompt. It was trained using a synthetic dataset generated via GPT-3 and existing text-to-image models.
